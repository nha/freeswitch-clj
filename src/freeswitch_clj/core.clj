              `(fn [conn event-map])`.

  Returns:
  Response of the event command.

  Note:
  Setting an event handler for event `ALL` will change the default
  event handler. This handler does not receive all events; rather
  it receives events missing an explicit handler.

  Examples:
     ;; Listen for a regular event.
     (req-event
       conn
       \"CALL_UPDATE\"
       (fn [conn event] (println \"Got a call update!\")))

     ;; Listen for a custom event.
     (req-event
       conn
       \"CUSTOM\"
       \"menu:enter\"
       (fn [conn event] (println \"Inside a menu!\")))

     ;; Listen for all events and setup a default event handler.
     (req-event
       conn
       \"ALL\"
       (fn [conn event] (println event)))
